            <h1>Current Role: Lead Software Developer at Antech Diagnostics</h1>
            <h3>Since September, 2022</h3>
            <p>
                I joined the Telecytology project as a team lead after the founding principal developer had left for other opportunities.
                The project was new for Heska, as they were used to embedded software and medical scanning devices. 
                The Telecytology product was a Software as a Service (SaaS), web API hosted on the cloud. 
                Since the company was merged with Antech, and I have played multiple roles for this product, from project and product manager
                to managing and hiring new team members. I have successfully managed projects involving multiple teams to integrate HVT into 
                other platforms and users across the company, and am continuing to help advocate for better UI/UX expereiences for customers.

                $10+ M recurring revenue service deployed worldwide allowing for veterinary practices and hospitals to create cases for patients and digitally upload sample images. 
                The digital and cloud component of the product has allowed turnaround times on pathology cases that normally took one or several days for samples to deliver to labs to instead return in less than an hour.

                While the company had changed names several times, I had the opportunity to work on the Next Generation 911 (ng911) project. 
                This project was a service offered to emergency call centers around the nation and provided geolocation data for Multiline, VOIP, and Wireless calls in compliance of Kari's Law.
