                    I've played tabletop roleplaying games with my friends since high school. 
                    While everyone now can recognize Dungeons and Dragons, my very first game was sitting down at the cafeteria table to see
                    my friends playing a game called Rifts. A science fantasy game that melded robots and mech suits with monsters and magic
                    in a post apocalyptic earth, I would go on to own quite a few Palladium games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, I've kept all of the games that I've played over the years. 
                    Star Wars RPG, Star Trek, Heroes Unlimited, Vampire: The Masquerade, Pathfinder, and many more. 
                    They diligently sit on my bookshelf, waiting to be pulled to serve as resources to build stories in any game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dungeons and Dragons was the most popular game to play by far. 
                    Amongst all of my friends, across any bulletin board in any game store, there was always a group playing Dungeons and Dragons that was looking for more players.
                    This was where I started not just playing games but running games as a Dungeon Master, as well as creating my own adventures and stories.

                <p>
                    A dungeon master is the key component in nearly every roleplaying group. 
                    The role is so much more than someone to manage the rules and dictate the actions of the enemies the players face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A dungeon master for a roleplaying game is the business equivalent of a 
                    owner, founder, project manager, mentor, graphic desgner, marketing, as well as any other role that may be needed at a moment's notice.
