      <h3>Software Developer</h3>
      <p>
        I have been a software engineer for over nine years. 
        Coding programs and solutions has given me an opportunity to find creativity and experimentation in my professional career.
        Part of what I love about software development is that I am not limited to learn and explore by my workspace. I am free to 
        study and research what I'm interested in on my time.

        Outside of coding, I enjoy tabletop games and roleplaying, painting miniatures, and

        balanced.
